<ol>
<li> <u> Where did the name come from? </u> <br>
    The rather whimsical name, which rhymes with Einstein, is easy to remember 
    and suggests its origin in the physics, rather than computer graphics, 
    community.</li><br>
<li> <u> What was the motivation for writing einspline? </u> </br>
    There don't appear to be any generally-available libraries for the
    creation of 2D and 3D interpolating B-splines.  These turn out to
    be very useful for representing orbitals in Quantum Monte Carlo
    computations.  They are also useful for many other things, but QMC
    was my main motivation.</li><br/>
<li> <u> Why stop at three-dimensional splines? </u><br/> 
    I didn't have a use for higher than 3D.  The ideas are quite
    easy to generalize to higher dimensionality, but the coding can get
    a bit tedious.  If there is a good application for it, and I
    had time, I might code a set of 4D routines. </li><br/>
<li><u> Are there binding for languages other than C?</u><br/>
    There are currently Fortran bindings.  I would like to C++ and (possibly)
    Python bindings when time permits.</li><br/>
<li><u> What are the licensing terms of einspline?</u><br/>
    einspline is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">3-clause BSD license</a>. </li><br/>
<li><u> How do I compile the library on Windows?</u><br/>
    I have no idea.  I almost never use Windows and have no compilers
    for that platform.  One user has reported that he was able to get
    the library to compile, but I cannot help you with that.</li><br/>

<li> <u> Where are all the other frequently asked questions in this FAQ? </u><br>
    Besides this one, they haven't been written, yet. </li> <br>
