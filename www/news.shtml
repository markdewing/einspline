<h2> 2/20/18 </h2>
Einspline is now licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">3-clause BSD license</a>.
<h2> 1/28/09 </h2>
For the past few releases, einspline has included optional routines which
run on NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA.  Because of the high memory bandwidth available
on graphics cards, these routines may run 10x - 20x faster than on CPUs.
<h2> 1/18/08 </h2>
Releasing einspline-0.8.0.  This release contains new functions which, for a 
given evaluation point, evaluate a whole set of splines with a single
evaluation call.  For large numbers of splines, this can result in
a very significant speedup -- in some cases 4x!  The functions are
very similar to the single-spline version.  Only uniform multi-splines
have been implemented so far.
<h2> 10/31/07 </h2>
einspline-0.7.7 was released today.  It fixes an off-by-one error in the 
construction of nonuniform B-spline bases.
<h2> 5/11/07 </h2>
Today, einspline 0.6 will be released today.  This release includes Fortran 77
wrappers to the C library.
<h2> 5/8/07 </h2>
einspline-0.5 was released today.  This is the initial public release
of the library.  I have tested it, but not extensively.  Please report
any bugs to kpesler AT ciw DOT edu.
